# MiMA

## Mission

In order to help emerging artists find exhibition spaces where to show their work and at the same time help venues gain new contacts and expand their audience, we created MiMA. A unique service for art spaces looking for emerging artists to exhibit. 
Available venues can post their offers on the platform to increase the quantity and quality of the applicants. Artists have access to available art spaces and can contact gallery owners directly. 

Our mission is to promote the outstanding art of emerging artists so that their work can be taken to the next level, because we believe that fresh artistic voices deserve a chance to be heard.
